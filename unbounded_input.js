// later on will be updated to include a button which allows changing between bounded and unbounded mode. unbounded mode will limit input from range [1, 100] but
// will not consider pet rarity. it will assume the pet rarity given the level and calculate feed power/fame required to any level higher. this will be set as
// the default mode once implemented, as it is more useful.
